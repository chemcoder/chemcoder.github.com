Hi folks , this is my git hub pages project


For many a days i wanted to show off a personal blog and wasnt getting a good one to build on . I tried pelican and found it confusing and then i tried jekyll and i had to do a lot of work so finally i opted for octopress its really amazing and only thing it lacks is a local server i cannot check the development
